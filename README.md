# LinkIt 7688 Duo Tank
Using a LinkIt 7688 Duo to replace the internals of an R/C toy tank.

### This will use 6 digital pins on the LinkIt 7688 Duo to control 2 dc motors. 
I connected 3 pins for each motor to an H bridge and use the LinkIt 7688 Duo to control the flow of current based on each pin's value.
